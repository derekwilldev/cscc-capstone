        <h1>Get to know S-mart</h1>
        <p>S-Mart was established in 1981 as a local department store in Alma, Michigan. A young man named John Smart wanted to provide his small hometown a more convenient shopping experience, so he opened a small corner store named after himself. The store initially opened with a staff of five with Mr. Smart serving as the owner and manager of the store himself, and still does to this day.</p>

        <p>That same year, in 1981, a few of his employees took a camping trip in Morristown, Tennessee where they experienced a horrific poltergeist-type ordeal. The story intrigued Mr. Smart so much he made this town his first place of expansion for the business in the year 1989. He personally has never experienced (anything when visiting this location).</p>

        <p>It would remain the two stores for quite some time. It was in 2013 that Mr. Smart was able to make a national chain of S-Mart after meeting investor Bruce Campbell. The company grew to six stores, spread across the U.S.</p>

        <p>Both, Mr. Smart and Mr. Campbell, are happy to be offering such affordable prices and convenience to not only the smaller communities, but the largest in the U.S. S-Mart has been around for some time, and we hope to remain here for a long time doing what we do best; helping customers shop smart. S-Mart.</p>
